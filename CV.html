            <h1>My CV</h1>
            <p> 
            I have a lot of passion for coding and art as a young man.
            Being self taught, I can code in C++ and Python as well as developing websites. 
            I love 3D modelling, programming, drawing, digital scultping, and
            game programming as well as travelling, swimming and cooking. Having had the opportunity
            to study aboard, I am fluent in three languages - Chinese, English and French.
